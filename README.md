# Data mining: Association rules generation - Apriori
Generate association rules using apriori principle using different values of support,confidence,lift etc.

### Methods used for candidate generation:
- Fk-1 X Fk-1
- Fk-1 X Fk

I have used both bruteforce and candidate level pruning in rules generation. It is obvious and observed that candidate level pruning is efficient than bruteforce method.

### Measures used for rules evaluation:
- Support
- Confidence
- Lift
